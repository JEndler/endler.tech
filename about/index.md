# About me

I am a French developer based in Berlin. I currently work at [datawallet.io](https://datawallet.io) and I'm pretty happy. 

You can ask me anything on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nbrugneaux).

## About this site

This site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) under the [nicolasbrugneaux/nicolasbrugneaux.github.io](https://github.com/nicolasbrugneaux/nicolasbrugneaux.github.io) repository.

The styling of this website has not been done by me, but by the amazing Hugo Giraudel. He made this and all credits should be go to him. [Have a look](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/hugogiraudel.github.com).
