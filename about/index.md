# About me

I am a French developer based in Berlin. I'm currently lead engineer at [Datawallet](https://datawallet.com) and lovin' it. Also, we're hiring!

If you wish for a more private way of contacting me, you can reach <br>
me via [hello@nicolasbrugneaux.me](mailto:hello@nicolasbrugneaux.me).

## About this site

This site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) under the [nicolasbrugneaux/nicolasbrugneaux.github.io](https://github.com/nicolasbrugneaux/nicolasbrugneaux.github.io) repository.

The styling of this website has not been done by me, but by the amazing Hugo Giraudel. He made this and all credits should be go to him. [Have a look](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/hugogiraudel.github.com).
