Hey, I'm Jakob 👋

## Me in 10 seconds

I'm a data engineer turned startup founder, currently working on [Datapods](https://datapods.app), and on [Robowriter](https://robowriter.de).

📍 I'm based in Bonn, Germany.

🌱 I’m currently trying to grow into my role as Founder.

📝 I sometimes write stuff on [https://notes.endler.tech]

If I'm not coding, you'll probably find me watching Counter-Strike, painting Warhammer 40k models, or taking a walk.

## ⚡️ As of Q1 2024, I'm currently working on / exploring:

👀 Getting my startups Datapods and Robowriter off the ground
> Datapods just received ~270k€ in Funding from the EU, and are looking to launch in Q3 '24.

📚 Exploring Crypto/Web3

🏃🏼‍♂️ Keeping myself fit, though there hasn't been much time for that lately

📚 Currently reading Peopleware and Scaling People, both have been great so far :)

🧠 Optimizing my brain & body to live better, read about this in my [Notes](https://notes.endler.tech/notes/Optimizing-my-Brain-and-Body/Optimizing-my-Brain-and-Body/)
